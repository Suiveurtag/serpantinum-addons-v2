# Clawd, Claude Code desktop pet

Clawd is the Claude Code pixel mascot: a flat `#D97757` block with two black
eyes, arm stubs and four short legs, drawn from PNG strips at an integer scale
with no smoothing. He lives in Settings → Addons → General, in a terminal-style
card. Off by default; OFF unloads every window, timer and Hyprland socket. Only
the hook socket stays, so he knows what your agents are doing when he comes back.

## Controls

| Control | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `Super+Shift+L` | Toggle Clawd (`addonsV2Clawd`). Search `clawd` in Keybinds to change it; the installer preserves edits |
| Left drag | Pick him up; he follows the pointer, across monitors |
| Release | Falls onto whatever is under the drop point: a window top (he lands, then perches on it) or the floor of that screen |
| Left click | Small reaction (none while working); wakes him up; opens / closes the sessions journal |
| Middle click | Petpet: a hand pets him for ~3 s (`> <` eyes); middle click again while petted for `^ ^` eyes and hearts. While an agent works he only startles, then goes back to work |
| Right click | ASCII menu: `> sleep` / `> wake` (`> revive` while he is dead), `> hide` (turns Clawd off), `> settings`. Escape or an outside click closes it |

Left alone he walks along the bottom of his screen (above the bar's reserved
area), blinks, looks toward the pointer, sits, and falls asleep after the
configured idle delay. He also lives on your windows and follows the cursor to
other screens (below). Shell performance mode cuts idle actions and stops
pointer polling.

IPC, target `clawd`:

```sh
quickshell -p ~/.local/share/serpantinum/src/quickshell/Shell.qml ipc call clawd toggle
quickshell -p … ipc call clawd appear   # not "show": the quickshell CLI reads it as `ipc show`
quickshell -p … ipc call clawd hide
quickshell -p … ipc call clawd play walk   # "ok", "unknown" or "off"
quickshell -p … ipc call clawd state       # debug: JSON of his mode, support, windows and tracked sessions
```

`play` accepts any animation name from `clawd.json` (`idle`, `blink`,
`look_left`, `look_right`, `look_up`, `walk`, `turn`, `sit`, `sleep`, `drag`,
`fall`, `land`, `spawn`, `think`, `work`, `oops`, `alert`, `happy`, `petpet`, `petpetheart`,
`read`, `bash`, `search`, `web`, `task`, `todo`, `compact`, `startled`, `edit`, `edit_2`, `work_2`, `read_2`,
`bash_2`, `search_2`, `web_2`, `task_2`, `todo_2`, `think_2`, `happy_2`, `celebrate`, `sweat`, `coin`, `sad`, `wave`,
`explode`, `perch`, `perch_look`, `hop`, `stumble`, `teeter`, `peek`, `nuke`, `dead`, `dead_land`, `revive`, `tada`, ...; 59 in all); loops play
for about 3 s, then normal behaviour resumes. Scenes: `play explode` previews the singularity (about 37 s), `play nuke` the nuclear
variant (about 20 s), `play limit` either at random (Escape skips to the end; both leave him dead); `play surge` the superpowered
weekly variant (about 41 s, he survives it); `play revive` brings him back.
Nothing else plays while he is dead.

## Windows and screens

With `windows` on (card row `world`, `addonsV2ClawdWorld`, default on), Clawd sees the
Hyprland windows of the active workspaces (`j/clients` on Hyprland's socket, not
`Hyprland.toplevels`, which keeps closed windows):

- Window tops are ledges when the window is not maximized or fullscreen, is wider than him
  plus 40 px and has room above it under the bar (in practice floating windows: tiled ones
  start right under the bar). Each screen also has its floor.
- Dropped above a window, or falling past one, he lands on it and perches (seated on its top
  edge, legs dangling). He rides it when it moves, walks along the visible part of its top
  (never into a window in front of it), teeters at its ends, then hops down or turns back.
  When the window closes, moves to another workspace, gets covered or maximized, or jumps
  away (more than 200 px at once, he is startled), he falls and lands with `oops`.
- A quarter of his walks explore: a hop onto a window top close above him, a peek from
  behind a window edge (he walks in until two thirds of him are hidden, looks out for
  3–6 s, then walks out; moving the window makes him step out), or a walk toward the cursor.
- Reactions, at most one every 5 s and six a minute, each with its own cooldown: a window
  opening on his screen → he looks at it; a window closing within 300 px → `startled`; focus
  moving to a window on his screen → a glance (only while idle, sitting or perched); switching
  workspace on his screen while he is on the floor → `stumble` (on a window he just falls).
  None while an agent works or asks for permission, while asleep, dragged or petted, or while
  the menu is open.

With `follow` on (`addonsV2ClawdFollow`, default on), when the cursor stays on another screen
for two checks in a row (2 s apart) and he is idle, sitting or perched (no agent busy, menu and
journal closed), he goes there: across the screen edge when the next screen's floor is
within his height of his own, otherwise he walks off his edge and drops in from the top of
the cursor's screen, near the cursor. Perched, he hops down first.

Performance mode: no exploring, no following, windows refreshed on Hyprland events plus
every 3 s instead of every 240 ms (60 ms while he rides a window), halved reaction budget; he
still lands on windows after a drop and falls when they go away. While he sleeps the window
list is refreshed on events only (every 3 s too when he sleeps on a window). With `windows`
off he is back to the floor of his screen only.

`ipc call clawd state` adds `support` (`null` = the floor, or `{kind: "win", id, dx}`), `cover`
(the window rect he peeks from behind) and `world` (`wins`: windows on screen, `ledges`,
`refreshes`: window snapshots taken).

## Claude Code and Codex

The card's `hooks` row connects each agent (`[ ] claude · [ ] codex · [ ] stats`, the last one is
Claude's status line relay, below). Nothing touches
`~/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.codex/hooks.json` before you click; Codex then asks
you to trust the new hooks. The same thing from a terminal:

```sh
python3 ~/.local/share/serpantinum-addons-v2/scripts/clawd/hooks.py <status|install|uninstall> <claude|codex|statusline>
```

It adds one group per event next to the existing ones (Capri's included), writes a
`<file>.clawd-backup-<date>` before every change, and removes only commands running
`clawd-hook.js`. The hook (`scripts/clawd/hooks/clawd-hook.js`, node) sends one JSON line
`{agent, event, session_id, tool_name, notification_type, dir, pids, target, model}` (`pids`: the hook's
ancestor processes, used to find the terminal window) to
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/serpantinum/clawd.sock`. It always exits 0 within 500 ms and does nothing
when the shell is not running.

Privacy: no prompts, replies or full tool inputs ever leave the hook. `target` is a short
label of the action (24 characters at most, control and bidi characters stripped, `PreToolUse` only):
a file's base name for reads and edits, only the program name of a shell command (leading
`VAR=value` assignments skipped, quoted values included; anything but a plain name such as `$(…)` gives
nothing, so no arguments, paths or secrets), the search pattern, the
host of a fetched URL, the web search query, a sub-agent's description, or `done/total` of a
todo list. Patterns, queries and descriptions are truncated, not filtered: they show above his
head in `full` thoughts mode, and stay in memory in the shell only (never written to disk).

| Event | Clawd |
| --- | --- |
| Prompt submitted | `think` or `think_2`, then his working loop in place while the turn runs; a new spinner verb |
| Tool failed | `oops`, then back to work |
| Permission request | `alert` (hops) + `⚠ permission · <dir>` until that session moves on |
| Idle prompt / Codex asks a question | `… waiting · <dir>` for 8 s |
| Turn finished | `happy` or `happy_2` + `✓ done · <dir>` for 8 s; `celebrate` (confetti) after a turn of 3 min or more |
| Turn failed (Claude `StopFailure`: API error, limit…) | `sad` + `✗ error · <dir>` for 8 s |
| Session start | `wave`, except when Claude restarts the session after a compaction (and the spinner verbs are re-read, at most every 30 s) |
| Compaction (Claude) | `compact` (squashed flat) |
| Stats (`Status`, see below): cost crosses a new multiple of $5 | `coin` |
| Stats: 5-hour / 7-day limit reaches 100 % | nuke / singularity (then dead) or surge, at random for 7 days |

While working he plays the loop of the last tool used by the lead session (the working
session that moved last), picking at random between the loop and its `_2` variant each time
the tool family changes, and switching variant every 8–12 s:

| Tool | Loop |
| --- | --- |
| `Read`, `NotebookRead`, `view_image` | `read` (book) / `read_2` (scroll unrolling) |
| `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`, `apply_patch` | `edit` (pencil on a notepad) / `edit_2` (sheet held up, diff lines) |
| `Bash`, `BashOutput`, `KillShell`, `exec_command`, `write_stdin`, `shell`, `local_shell` | `bash` (terminal above his head) / `bash_2` (output scrolling) |
| `Grep`, `Glob`, `LS`, `ToolSearch` | `search` (magnifier) / `search_2` (crouched, scanning the ground) |
| `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `web_search` | `web` (globe) / `web_2` (antenna with signal waves) |
| `Task`, `Agent`, `spawn_agent` | `task` (a mini Clawd) / `task_2` (two mini Clawds hopping) |
| `TodoWrite`, `update_plan` | `todo` (checklist) / `todo_2` (ticking boxes) |
| anything else (MCP…) | `work` (keyboard) / `work_2` (fast two-hand typing) |

When the lead session is strained (context ≥ 80 % or 5-hour limit ≥ 90 %), each variant switch
has a 1 in 3 chance to be a `sweat` break instead. The lead's reasoning effort sets his typing
speed: low ×0.75, medium ×1, high ×1.25, xhigh and max ×1.5.

Several sessions merge: alert beats work beats normal life. A session with no event for
2 minutes is forgotten, except one waiting for a permission. With two or more busy
sessions a `[n]` counter shows beside his head.

### Stats (Claude status line)

The third toggle of the `hooks` row, `[ ] stats`, makes Claude Code's status line run
`scripts/clawd/hooks/clawd-status.js` (`hooks.py <status|install|uninstall> statusline`).
It relays one `Status` line per status refresh:
`{agent: "claude", event: "Status", session_id, dir, pids, model, effort, ctx, cost, five_hour, seven_day, five_hour_resets}`
(model display name, effort level, context used %, session cost in USD, 5-hour / 7-day usage %; numbers
that are not finite are left out). If you already had a status line, its command is wrapped
(`node clawd-status.js -- <your command>`): it still runs with the same input and its output is
shown unchanged; disconnecting restores it exactly. Without one, Clawd's prints nothing, so no
status line row appears. Status lines only update the stats of a session (an unknown session is
created idle); they never change what he is doing.

### Thoughts

While the lead session works, one line floats above his head, Claude Code spinner style:
`✻ Pondering… 1m 05s`. The glyph cycles `· ✢ ✳ ✶ ✻ ✽` in Clawd orange (a static `✻` in
performance mode); the verb is one of Claude Code's own spinner verbs, re-rolled every ~30 s,
and the elapsed time counts from the prompt. The verbs come from `scripts/clawd/verbs.py`,
which reads the list out of the installed `claude` (Bun binary or npm `cli.js`), applies
`spinnerVerbs` from `~/.claude/settings.json` (`append` / `replace`), and caches the result in
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/serpantinum-addons-v2/clawd-verbs.json`; a short generic list is used when
Claude Code is not installed.

In `full` mode the line also shows, for 2.5 s, what the lead session just started
(`Edit main.py`, `Bash npm`, at most one flash every 5 s), and every 14 s, for 4 s, the next of
`<model> · <effort>`, `ctx 42%`, `$1.24`, `5h 63% · 7d 20%` (with stats connected); strained values
show in peach and are preferred. `verbs` shows the verb and time only; `off` hides the line.
It never takes clicks, and hides while a bubble, the menu or the journal is open.

Clicking a bubble raises that session's terminal (`hyprctl dispatch focuswindow pid:…`,
the first of the hook's ancestors owning a window) and closes it. Left click on Clawd opens
the sessions journal, newest first: `⚠/✻/✓ agent dir tool elapsed ctx%` (context only with stats connected); click a row to raise
that terminal. Terminals behind tmux/screen cannot be found (the multiplexer server is not an
ancestor): nothing happens.

## Settings card

| Row | Setting |
| --- | --- |
| Enable | `addonsV2Clawd`, default off |
| Scale | `addonsV2ClawdScale`, 2–8× pixels, default 4 |
| Walk speed | `addonsV2ClawdSpeed`: calm, normal, active |
| Sleep after | `addonsV2ClawdSleep`, 1–60 minutes, default 5 |
| Summon on this screen | Respawns him on the focused monitor (disabled while off) |
| Shortcut | Opens Keybinds; search `clawd` there to change it |
| Hooks | Connect / disconnect Claude Code and Codex hooks, and the Claude status line relay (`stats`) |
| Thoughts | `addonsV2ClawdThoughts`: full (default), verbs, off |
| World | `addonsV2ClawdWorld` (`windows`: perching, peeking, exploring, window reactions) and `addonsV2ClawdFollow` (`follow` the cursor to other screens), both default on |

Settings are shared with the separate Settings process through `settings.json`,
so the card works in the Settings app and in the integrated `Super+Shift+P` panel.

## Animations

51 strips. Besides the idle life (`idle`, `blink`, `look_*`, `walk`, `turn`, `sit`, `sleep`,
`drag`, `fall`, `land`, `spawn`), petting (`petpet`, `petpetheart`, `startled`) and the working
loops above:

| Animation | fps / loop | When | Looks like |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `think`, `think_2` | 6 / once | prompt submitted | ✻ thinking; chin tap, `?` then a cream spark |
| `happy`, `happy_2` | 10 / once | turn finished | hop; jump and spin with arms up |
| `celebrate` | 10 / once | turn of 3 min or more finished | big jump, cream and pink confetti |
| `oops` | 10 / once | tool failed | shakes with a `!` beside his head |
| `alert` | 6 / loop | permission request | hops with a `!` |
| `compact` | 8 / once | compaction | squashed flat |
| `sweat` | 4 / loop | strained lead session, now and then while working | sweat drop, wipes his brow, pants |
| `coin` | 10 / once | session cost crosses a multiple of $5 | flips a cream coin and catches it |
| `sad` | 4 / once | turn failed | sinks a row, eyes down, a small tear |
| `wave` | 8 / once | session start | waves one arm |
| `perch` | 2 / loop | resting on a window top | seated on the edge, legs dangling below it, slow kicks |
| `perch_look` | 2 / once | perched, now and then; a window opens | same, eyes to one side |
| `hop` | 12 / once | hopping onto or off a window | crouch, stretch, tuck, landing squash (the jump itself is a tween) |
| `stumble` | 10 / once | workspace switched under him | trips forward, flails, rights himself |
| `teeter` | 6 / loop | at the end of a window top | tilts over the edge, arms windmilling |
| `peek` | 4 / loop | half hidden behind a window | eyes at the leading edge, blinks |

An animation may have a `grip` in `clawd.json`: the point that touches the support, in frame
pixels from the frame's top-left, unmirrored (`perch` and `perch_look`: the seat line
`[10.5, 12]`, so his legs hang below the window edge). Without one it is the bottom centre
(standing). Missing new animations fall back: `perch`/`perch_look` → `sit`, `hop` → `land`,
`stumble` → `oops`, `teeter` → `idle`, `peek` → `look_right`.

## Sprites

Frames are ASCII art in `scripts/clawd/frames/<animation>.txt`. After editing:

```sh
python3 scripts/clawd/sprites.py          # writes payload/clawd/sprites/*.png + clawd.json
python3 scripts/clawd/sprites.py --check  # exits 1 if committed outputs are stale
```

Output is deterministic. Palette: transparent, body `#D97757`, eyes `#000000`,
cream `#F0EEE6` for small props (sleep "z", ✻, keyboard, "!", paper, coin, confetti, sweat drop),
pink `#EC5B86` for petpet hearts, pencils, ticks and confetti. Frames face right; left is mirrored
at runtime. `hand.png` (the petpet hand, 7 frames frame-locked to `petpet*`) is cut out of
`scripts/clawd/hand-pet.gif`'s black background by the same script; its size is in `clawd.json` → `hand`.

## Install and remove

`python3 install.py` installs `payload/clawd/` to `quickshell/clawd/`, registers
the types in the root `qmldir`, hosts `AddonClawd` in `Shell.qml` and adds the
`Super+Shift+L` bind to `keybinds.lua`. `python3 install.py --without-clawd`
removes only Clawd's files, blocks, bind, hooks (both agents) and status line relay, with dated backups;
other addons are untouched.

## Validation

1. `python3 scripts/clawd/sprites.py --check` and
   `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
2. Install, enable the card switch: Clawd spawns at the bottom of the focused
   monitor. `Super+Shift+L` twice hides and shows him.
3. Drag him to another monitor (including ones with negative offsets) and
   release: he falls to that screen's floor. The rest of the desktop stays
   click-through.
4. Right-click: menu opens; Escape closes it; `> settings` opens Settings.
5. Change scale and speed in the card: the running pet follows immediately.
   Summon from Settings on another monitor.
6. Turn Clawd off: `qs-addon-clawd` layers disappear (`hyprctl layers`).
7. Connect Claude in the card, start a new session, send a prompt: think → work →
   happy + bubble, with `✻ <Verb>… 3s` above his head while he works. Same for Codex
   (trust the hooks first). A permission prompt makes him hop with `⚠ permission`.
8. Connect `stats`, start a new Claude session: the thought line cycles model, context, cost
   and limits; the journal shows the context %. Disconnect: a previous status line comes back.
9. Open a floating window, drop Clawd above it: he perches on it; move the window, he rides it;
   close it: he falls and says `oops`. Move the cursor to the other screen for a few seconds:
   he walks over. `ipc call clawd state` shows `support` and `world`.

### Quota limits and resets

A 5-hour limit reaching 100% plays `nuke`; a 7-day limit plays the singularity or the surge, at random (`limit7`). Each provider and window is tracked independently. A first reading at 100% establishes the current state without an explosion; a later observed transition from below 100% triggers it once per window. Stale lower readings cannot rearm the same window. At a known reset deadline, or when a fresh snapshot reports the next window, Clawd plays `recharge` for the 5-hour window; the 7-day reset is silent. Scenes wait their turn and revive him first if needed. Quota state is saved across shell restarts. The first reading after a restart establishes the current state, so an exhaustion missed while the shell was stopped is not replayed.

Claude needs the card's `stats` connection and a running session; Codex is polled every 30 s with `scripts/clawd/codex_limits.py`, which reads only the used % and reset time of the latest rate-limit snapshot in recent local session logs. If the provider has not supplied a recent snapshot, detection is best-effort.

About 37 s, on Clawd's screen, above everything (layer `qs-addon-clawd-blast`, Overlay); other screens darken,
flash and come back with it. He freezes, then the screen does (a `ScreencopyView` capture taken while he is
hidden); he glides to the middle, sucks the light out of the desktop while he heats up and trembles; silence, his
eyes cross; antimatter annihilation (flash, negative impact frames, plasma shell, shock and equatorial rings, gamma
rays, particle/antiparticle spiral tracks, his pixels flung out); a black hole swallows the desktop and the debris,
collapses into a star that blinks out; 5 s of black; an energy pulse brings the live desktop back and his corpse falls in.
The frozen screen takes clicks; Escape skips to the pulse. Apps keep running underneath.

Storyboard: `animations/SINGULARITY.md` in the Clawd project. Drawn frame by frame: `explode` (12 poses: hovering,
six charging stages, pure light, crossed eyes, three cracking open) and `antimatter` (12 frames, 49×49, the
annihilation core), both from `scripts/clawd/frames`. The rest is `ClawdBlast.qml` (a pure function of time) and
three shaders in `payload/clawd/shaders`: `desk.frag` (freeze tear, light drain, lit negative), `fx.frag` (light
threads, halo, the annihilation, on his pixel grid) and `lens.frag` (shake, chromatic split, impact negatives,
black hole lensing and infall, accretion disc, star, blackout, return pulse). After editing a `.frag`, run
`scripts/clawd/shaders.py` (`qsb` from Qt Shader Tools); the installer refuses a package that does not match its
source and installs each under its hash (Qt caches shaders by URL across reloads).

The nuke, about 20 s, same window and capture: a red alarm pulses in from the edges while he panics, running back and
forth at full tilt (frozen in terror once), the screen trembling; he stops near the middle, crouches and leaps; time
dilates (grey, cold, a slow camera push toward him, two heartbeats) while he hangs in the air; his eyes cross, a white
glint swells in his chest; four black-and-white impact frames; then the flash and a nuclear mushroom grows from the
floor under him, drawn frame by frame (`mushroom`, 28 frames of 96×96: fireball, condensation ring, rolling cap
cooling from white to dark red, embers, dissipation), glowing, with embers flung out, heat shimmer, a shock front,
the shake and chromatic split of `lens.frag`, the desktop lit and scorched by it; ash drifts down, everything fades
over the live desktop and his corpse falls where it went off. Storyboard: `animations/NUKE.md` in the Clawd project.
`ClawdNuke.qml` + `shaders/nuke.frag`; poses `nuke` (13).

### The surge (7-day limit, superpowered)

About 41 s, drawn by his overlay over the live desktop (click-through, `ClawdSurge.qml` + `shaders/{surge,bulge,clone}.frag`).
He jumps with a `!`, stares at the top-left corner where light bleeds along the edges and the screen bulges inwards
(`bulge.frag` on a capture taken at the start) until a magic orb tears through and hits him: black-and-white impact
frames, an explosion of light, violet smoke and glowing wisps. Poker-faced and sooty, he inhales all of it, flashes,
pulses with lightning and keeps an aura. He dashes right: the screen darkens, the camera zooms on his glowing wink, then
out; he leaves the screen and the overlay switches his screen to an empty workspace (`workspace emptynm`), he comes back
in twice as big, skids to the middle and strikes the floor, which lights up in colour and climbs the sides of the screen.
Six helpers arrive, one per effort level, each its own way (`clone` strip recoloured by `clone.frag`): low #FFC107 falls
from the sky, medium #4EBA65 rises from the floor, high #B1B9F9 materialises in a pillar (left side); xhigh #AF87FF
slides in with a white glint now and then, max (Claude Code's light colours, flowing) steps out of a rainbow portal,
ultra #9BF6FF comes with a lightning strike and crackles (right side). One by one they start working (typing, an ASCII
spinner line with a spinner verb) and each sends a vertical beam across the screen, stronger with the effort (sparks,
rings, white sweeps, rainbow, lightning arcs and shake). Then he rises, light at the end of his arms, their streams
arc into him and an ASCII bar recharges the week (`[#####.....]  48% left` -> `RESTORED`), a burst, the helpers vanish,
he lands, a blackout hides the way back to the workspace he left, and he stays in the middle of his screen.
Storyboard: `animations/SURGE.md` in the Clawd project. Poses `surge` (22); helpers `clone` (8, white body).

### Dead, and revived

After either scene Clawd is dead: grey, on his back with his legs in the air, crosses for eyes, smoke rising from him
(`smoke`, 15×16, 12 frames). He no longer reacts to anything (agents, petting, dragging, the journal, the windows);
his thought line and `[n]` are hidden, bubbles still show. Death is kept in Config (`addonsV2ClawdDead`, when he
died) so a reload finds his corpse. He comes back with `> revive` in his menu, when a new Claude Code / Codex session
starts (`SessionStart`, not a compaction), or when the shell starts (or Clawd is turned on) 3 hours or more after he
died. The revival (about 9 s, `ClawdRevive.qml` + `shaders/revive.frag`, drawn by his overlay, click-through): the
screen dims, a spotlight comes down on him, holy powder falls on the corpse, which floats up glowing and turns white,
bursts back into his colours, drops down and goes ta-da (`tada`) with rays of light behind him.
